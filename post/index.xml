子供から大人まで人気の桜井和寿さんですが、
実は子供が４人もいるビッグダディなのです！
２回の結婚経験のある桜井和寿さんですが、
現在の子供は、前の嫁さんとの間に１人、今の嫁さんとの間に３人と、
足して４人いるということになります。
あまりにメディアに登場しない桜井和寿さんですが、
子供の話自体もあまりしません。
離婚して再婚した当初は、
週刊誌にも子供のことも書かれていましたが、
今となっては、特にそこを突っ込む記事も少ないです。
現在の桜井和寿さんの子供と、
その子供の名前などを調べて見ました。
桜井和寿の４人の子供の名前（今嫁３人と元嫁１人）
桜井和寿さんは１９９４年に、
当時のバンドのマネージャーだった女性「ゆかり」さんと結婚、
同年に第一子の女の子が誕生しています。
桜井和寿さんの第１子の長女の名前は「優歌」です。
この長女はすでに大学を出てる年齢なので、
もしかしたら一緒には住んでいないかも？
地下アイドルの「桜井優香」という方が、
桜井和寿さんの長女と一文字違いということで、
「ミスチルの桜井さんの娘がアイドル？」と勘違いされる方もいたみたいです。（実際は全然違う方です）
桜井和寿さんの第２子は、離婚して吉野美佳さんと再婚した２０００年の翌年の、
２００１年６月に誕生しました。第２子は男の子で名前は「海音」（カイト）です。
その２年後の２００３年４月に第３子の男の子「愛音」（まなと）が誕生。さらに５年後の２００８年３月に第４子の男の子「奏音」（そら）が誕生。
今の嫁さんとの間に生まれた子供３人は、全員が男の子ということになりますね！
桜井和寿の歴代の嫁と子供の一覧 自分の文章ではちょっとわかりにくいので簡潔にまとめると、
１９９４年１０月 第１子「優歌（ゆうか）」女の子（元嫁のゆかりさん）
２００１年６月 第２子「海音（かいと）」男の子（現嫁の美佳さん）
２００３年４月 第３子「愛音（まなと）」男の子（現嫁の美佳さん）
２００８年３月 第４子「奏音（そら）」男の子（現嫁の美佳さん）
これが桜井和寿さんの子供の名前のすべてですね！
長男の海人くんは近頃メディアに出て有名になっています。
次男と三男も、そのうちメディアに出る日が来るかもしれません。
乃木坂４６に在籍していた桜井玲香は娘ではない。「きっかけ」カバーが噂の発端 一時期、桜井和寿さんの前嫁との娘が乃木坂で活躍しているとの噂がありましたが、あれはデマです。
ちなみに噂になったアイドルの子の名前は「桜井玲香」と名字以外、全然違います。
2016年のライブで桜井和寿さんが乃木坂の楽曲「きっかけ」をカバーしたことで、ネット上で間違った関連付けをされてしまい、そのような噂が出てしまったのです。
桜井和寿と吉野美佳の子供の学校は和光系列説が濃厚 桜井さんの子供が和光系列の幼稚園に通っているのは皆知っていると思いますが、中学や高校はどのような学校に進学しているのでしょうか？
B’zの稲葉さんの子供は青学系列でしたが、もしかしたら桜井さんの子供も、名門系列の学校に通われているのかもしれません。
きっと、勉強ができる場合は慶應か早稲田、まぁまぁなら法政か青学の中学・高校を受験しているのかな？と憶測します。
仮に全く勉強ができなかった場合は、そのままエスカレーターで和光系列に進学していることでしょう。幼稚園から知ってる友達と一緒なんて最高じゃないですか！
仮にサッカーの才能がある場合は、東京の帝京、神奈川の桐蔭学園などから推薦が来ると思いますが、それは確率的には低いですね・・・笑
2018年に成城に豪邸を建てたことで和光説が現実的に 桜井和寿さんと家族は長く田園調布に自宅を構えていましたが、2018年に成城に10億円の豪邸を建てています。
成城という土地は和光系列の学校の近所ということで、子供の通学の都合を考えて引っ越した可能性が高いです。
ちなみに浜田雅功さんの息子さんも和光系列に通い、自宅も成城学園付近にありました。
桜井和寿の長男・海音(Kaito )は強豪サッカーチームで活躍も辞めて父と同じ道へ 桜井さんは根っからサッカー好きで有名ですが、自分の子供たちもその影響を受けてるそうです。
再婚した美佳さんとの間に生まれた長男・海音（かいと）君は、Jリーグ名門クラブの下部組織で活躍していました。
海音くんが幼少期の頃は、サッカーチームの練習に桜井さんが顔を出したという目撃談もあります。
少年サッカーの会場にミスチルの桜井さんが子供の応援に現れたとしたら、めっちゃびっくりしますし、どう接して良いのかわかりませんね！笑
桜井和寿さんが仕事で子供とサッカーしていたことがありましたが、とても手慣れてて楽しそうでした。きっと普段一緒に遊んでる長男の海音くんのことを思い出して愛おしく思いながら遊んだことでしょう。
プロを目指してサッカーをプレーしていましたが、挫折を経験し、現在は父と同じ音楽の道に進みました。
長男・海音は現在はミュージシャン。父の名が重たくて「Kaito」から「海音」に改名？ サッカーの才能があった長男ですが、その後にサッカーで挫折してしまったそうです。
僕はずっと幼少期からサッカーをやっていて、中学2、3年生くらいまで11年間ほどはプロを目指してプレーしていました。その後、音楽を始めたり、違う方向が見つかったりと、サッカーから離れる時期がありました。そこからはフットサルなどを仲間内でエンジョイでやるようになりました。今ではオフの日はずっとフットサルをやっていますね。
その後に音楽に目覚め、ドラムは始め、今では「インナージャーニー」というバンドでドラムとして所属しています。</description></item><item><title>Alienware Area-51 Threadripper Edition Announced at E3, Available for Order July 27</title><link>/alienware-area51-threadripper-edition-announced-at-e3-available-for-order-july-27.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/alienware-area51-threadripper-edition-announced-at-e3-available-for-order-july-27.html</guid><description>Alienware this evening has announced their new Area-51 Threadripper Edition desktop at E3.
