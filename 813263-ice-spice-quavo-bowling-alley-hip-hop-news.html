Regardless, that didn't stop <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Quavo</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a> from having a good time at a bowling alley with friends, as a video recently surfaced of the two taking a picture together at the venue. Of course, it's unclear whether they just ran into each other or all went out together, so some gossip will likely stir. After all, the Saweetie part of the former Migo's <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chris Brown</a> drama showed that people seem <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">pretty invested in his romantic life</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But in the case of Ice Spice, relationship rumors can't really compare to the excitement around the announcement of her debut studio album, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Y2K</a>. There's already a lot of conversation around whether or not she will continue her trademark style or bring something new to the table, as well as potential guests and sounds. The Bronx femcee is building a lot of momentum off of her breakout 2023, and while there's a lot of competition, she seems comfortable in that space. What's dominance without a challenge?</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-amp-quavo-go-for-a-bowl>Ice Spice & Quavo Go For A Bowl</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for Quavo, he recently linked up with Ian and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">teased a new collaboration together</a>, which should be a fun time for younger hip-hop listeners who mess with the Valedictorian. We don't really know the nature of this meeting with Ice Spice, but we don't have to and there are much better things going on with both that we should pay more attention to. The Georgia MC already dropped a solo album last year and, in addition to his Breezy beef, has some more singles in this year's discog. With that in mind, we'll see whether the gossip train is inevitable here.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Ice Spice recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">defended the clowned album cover</a> for Y2K and its creator David LaChapelle on Twitter. "David LaChapelle is #Y2K! soooo sweet + legendary he didn't even charge me cus he f**ks wit a real b***h," she wrote in the caption of a photo of the two. "Thank U for all the incredible art you've put out through the years this cover means everything to me & yes Y2K was placed on the trash can on purpose can u guess why?"</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZoBzgpJmoJydXai9qq%2FEZqiumaakeqO71qWgp59dlrmtsdhmn6KoXZ28sXnNnq6s</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacqueline-cleggett.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacqueline Cleggett</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-monty-williams-wife-ingrid-die-crash-speeding-car-meth-influence-children-safe-suns-lost-bucks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How did Monty Williams' wife die?
