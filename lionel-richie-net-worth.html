Here's the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Lionel Richie's net worth?</h2><p>Lionel Brockman Richie Jr. was born in Tuskegee, Ala., on the campus of the Tuskegee Institute. His father was a U.S. Army System Analyst, and his mother was a teacher. From an early age, he was a star athlete but primarily considered a career attending divinity school to become a priest in the Episcopal Church.</p><p>During his time as a student in Tuskegee, Lionel began his musical career as a singer and saxophonist for the Commodores. The group signed a recording contract in 1968 and became established as a popular soul group. Lionel frequently wrote more romantic, easy-listening ballads but didn't achieve commercial success on his own until 1974. His song "Happy People" was co-written with Jeffrey Bowen and Donald Baldwin and rose to number 1.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 1980, Lionel also composed "Lady" for Kenny Rogers, which also quickly rose to number 1 on music charts. In 1981, he duetted with Diana Ross on "Endless Love" for the film of the same name. The success of "Endless Love" encouraged Richie to pursue a solo career, which he began in 1982. The same year, he released his first solo album, Lionel Richie. His 1983 follow-up album Can't Slow Down received twice as much critical praise.</p><p>By 1984, Lionel was performing at the Olympics, composing Top 10 hits constantly and collaborating with music legends such as Michael Jackson, Dionne Warwick, and Diana Ross. His career began to slow down during the early 2000s after his albums in the late 1990s failed to match the success of his earlier work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Lionel Richie</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer, Songwriter, Record Producer, Television Judge</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $200 Million</p><p>Lionel Brockman Richie Jr. grew up with aspirations to become a priest but quickly forewent his aspirations after joining the funk band the Commodores as a student in 1968.
