It is most widely known for its metro Atlanta population sign on Peachtree Road, but has quietly become one of the few apartment buildings in the area affordable for low-income residents.</p><p class=story-text data-index=6>In 2015, real estate services giant JLL&nbsp;<a href=#>marketed The Darlington</a>&nbsp;and its nearly 7.5 acres of land as prime for investors, with the potential to rehab the building to seek higher rents.&nbsp;Last year the 612-unit complex was sold for $30 million to Atlanta-based&nbsp;<a href=#>Varden Capital Properties</a>, which was founded in 2011 "with the objective of acquiring undervalued real estate, repositioning the asset and creating positive returns for its investors," its website says.</p><p class=story-text data-index=7>The company declined to comment despite initially agreeing to an interview.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Charles Pugh</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/news/local/tenants-ordered-leave-one-buckhead-last-low-rent-complexes/C0hlAAEEihV3iuJmhR3oQN/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Charles Pugh</p><p class=story-text data-index=10>Monthly rents at The Darlington today range from $600 to $1,200, a resident said.&nbsp;At the Brookwood Valley apartments next door, a 555-square-foot one-bedroom is $970; a two-bedroom goes for $1,441. Further north, the&nbsp;Alexan Buckhead Village offers a one-bedroom for $1,790 and a two-bedroom plus den — a floorplan called the&nbsp;“Veuve Cliquot” — for&nbsp;$3,015.</p><p class=story-text data-index=12>“I’ve clearly been priced out,” said&nbsp;Je’ Wesley Day, a tenant who makes a living as a cocktail journalist.&nbsp;Most of the building’s tenants are African-American, veterans, elderly or sick, he said, and many benefit from the proximity to Piedmont Hospital down the street.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>During his three years at The Darlington, he has experienced run-ins with management and break-ins to his car and apartment, he said. Despite feeling unsafe, Day said he stayed because of the affordability.</p><p class=story-text data-index=14>When tenants were given notice to leave, they were also provided with a list of low-income properties to assist in their search,&nbsp;which included places such as Wheat Street Towers on Auburn Avenue and Maggie Russel Tower Apartments on Ralph McGill Boulevard. Day said many of the places were either in crime-ridden neighborhoods, too expensive or unavailable.</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>The Mayor's Office declined to comment, but a spokeswoman confirmed that the Office of Constituent Services is looking into what, if any, assistance can be offered to displaced residents.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/news/local/tenants-ordered-leave-one-buckhead-last-low-rent-complexes/C0hlAAEEihV3iuJmhR3oQN/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=story-text data-index=19>One morning this week, a reporter from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution observed many windows flung open in the summer heat, some held open with fans.&nbsp;Residents have complained that the building’s air conditioning hasn’t been working after they were given the Aug. 16 notices to vacate, making it hard even to sleep at night.</p><p class=story-text data-index=20>Nathan Duffey, who’d said he’d witnessed the building decline over his six years at The Darlington, found a new apartment at Morgan Place in DeKalb County.</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>“Rent will be more than I’m paying now, but I can never do this again,” Duffey said, referring to his living conditions.</p><p class=story-text data-index=22>The freight elevator, transportation crucial for a mass of people needing to move, has been broken for three years, Duffey said. On the 10th floor, a microwave, desk and other abandoned possessions lay at the perpetually closed elevator doors.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/news/local/tenants-ordered-leave-one-buckhead-last-low-rent-complexes/C0hlAAEEihV3iuJmhR3oQN/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=story-text data-index=25>On most of the 15 floors, smelly trash chutes overflowed. Ceiling tiles were missing and buckets caught drips in quiet, dimly-lit hallways. The pool out back was closed and half-filled with green water, a far cry from many years ago when tenants said bikini-clad women would gather around.</p><p class=story-text data-index=26>One wall featured graffiti with an expletive about the building. On another, a flyer advertising a reward for up to $10,000 for arson tips was posted. (Atlanta firefighters went to the building in response to small fires twice last month; one is still an open investigation.)</p><p class=story-text data-index=27>Atlanta police have received 200 calls and initiated 54 directed patrols or drop-ins to the apartments for various issues this year, officials said.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/news/local/tenants-ordered-leave-one-buckhead-last-low-rent-complexes/C0hlAAEEihV3iuJmhR3oQN/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=story-text data-index=29>Yet some of the apartment windows offer the kind of Buckhead skyline view&nbsp;— shiny buildings towering above a sea of green treetops — that people have come to pay top dollar for.</p><p class=story-text data-index=31>It’s not just residents that must leave. A few retail shops on the bottom floor have also been given the boot.</p><p class=story-text data-index=32>Colombian-born designer Joseph Plata has run a fashion studio out of The Darlington since 1996.</p><p class=story-text data-index=33>“It was better in the beginning because it wasn’t in such a bad state,” he said. “The building has been on a decline, so it’s time to go.”</p><p class=story-text data-index=34>The mandate to leave is a&nbsp;nerve-wracking inconvenience, he said, because retail rates in Atlanta have gotten so high. If they can’t find a suitable place in time,&nbsp;they’ll have to temporarily work out of their homes. But he’s also excited and optimistic about the future.</p><p class=story-text data-index=35>Plata and his two full-time employees have gotten to know the tenants over the years. They’d throw birthday parties for the elderly, set up meals on holidays and&nbsp;let young students use their iron.</p><p class=story-text data-index=37>One of Plata’s employees said working out of The Darlington has made the small crew “better people” — more understanding and empathetic. She looked out the storefront at a man who often acts erratically, though she believes him to be harmless.</p><p class=story-text data-index=38>“I wonder what’s going to happen to him?” she asked.</p><p class=story-text data-index=39>“He’ll go somewhere,” Plata answered.</p><p class=story-text data-index=40>“It’s going to be a big shock to him,” the woman said.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/news/local/tenants-ordered-leave-one-buckhead-last-low-rent-complexes/C0hlAAEEihV3iuJmhR3oQN/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=story-text data-index=43>In its almost seven-decade history, The Darlington has changed ownership and undergone multiple renovations. Yet it has been riddled with issues for decades.</p><p class=story-text data-index=44>In 1984, the complex was sued over claims minorities weren’t allowed to live above the 11th floor. In 1994 and 2017, outraged tenants made headlines by complaining of no hot water in the units. And in 2016, a decomposing body was found by police who were called there about a separate dead body. (Police said both died of natural causes.)</p><p class=story-text data-index=45>Through it all, Atlantans and visitors passing by have taken note of the population sign that guards the complex.&nbsp;On Wednesday morning, the sign read 6,760,017; constantly climbing, it had increased by 26 a couple hours later.</p><p class=story-text data-index=46>The sign, of course, won’t make any note of the exodus of tenants who must be gone by Oct. 16.&nbsp;Hundreds of people who could once afford to live in Buckhead, though, will no longer be able to make that claim.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/news/local/tenants-ordered-leave-one-buckhead-last-low-rent-complexes/C0hlAAEEihV3iuJmhR3oQN/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=story-text data-index=49>READ |&nbsp;<a href=#>Date set for the 28th annual AIDS Walk in Piedmont Park</a></p><p class=story-text data-index=50>READ |&nbsp;<a href=#>New courts at Buckhead tennis center to be renamed for late employee</a></p><p class=story-text data-index=52><b><i>Like Atlanta News Now on&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a> | Follow us on&nbsp;</i></b><b><i><a href=#>Twitter</a></i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orbCZ5qopV%2Bjsri%2FjqWmnJmcZMGmusCnq6xln6expr7EnWSlnZGrsm67zZ5km62ToLWmrcNmo5qrpGK5sMOMq5ynrF2YvK68y56vnqtfeH2puKB6fH6hmIuAqsGppp%2BLa5%2BGm3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./innodisk-unveils-fire-shield-ssd-withstands-800c-temperature-direct-flames.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Withstands 800C Temperature &amp;amp; Direct Flames</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-toaster-oven-black-friday-deals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The best toaster oven Black Friday deals on Breville, Ninja</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
