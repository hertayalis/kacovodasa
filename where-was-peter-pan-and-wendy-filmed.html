The remake spotlights a more diverse and inclusive cast to add a spin to the classic Peter Pan story. The cast of the movie includes <a href=#>Yara Shahidi</a>, Jude Law, and comedian Jim Gaffigan.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Viewers of the <a href=#>Disney+</a> film have started to wonder where the movie was filmed.

Producer Alice White talked about how Disney decided to use the area as the main filming spot for the movie.</p><p>She<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> said that</a>, "When Disney were trying to find the right place for the setting, they stumbled across some pictures of Newfoundland and they got in touch with the Newfoundland and Labrador Film Development Corporation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Alice also spoke about the undeniable tourism that the movie will bring to the Newfoundland area, but how Disney isn't the only company that is giving it attention.</p><p>She said, "Disney fans are known to do this kind of thing. They love Disney movies, and they seek out these locations. So I think if only a small percentage seek out Newfoundland, we'll be in good shape. I think about all the other shows, like Republic of Doyle, Hudson & Rex, Maudie … that have brought a lot of tourism to Newfoundland. I think a Disney film will only add to that."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Filming also took place on a sound stage <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in Vancouver</a>, Canada, with reshoots being done in Vancouver as well a year later due to COVID-19 delays between 2021 and 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The cast of 'Peter Pan & Wendy' enjoyed working in Newfoundland.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a>, the stars of the movie revealed that they loved working on-location for Peter Pan & Wendy. <a href=#>Alexander Molony</a>, who plays Peter Pan, said that it was, "Even more magical [than I was expecting].
