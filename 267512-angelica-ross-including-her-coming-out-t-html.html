Her company, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.advocate.com/print-issue/current-issue/2015/09/01/showgirl-ceo-trans-businesswoman-angelica-ross-tells-all>TransTech</a>, helped change the lives of trans people.</p><p class=dh>Ross's goal is to put technology in the hands of people <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vice.com/en/article/yp7dzw/angelica-ross-wants-to-help-people-in-transition>making</a> a transition of various types, whether it's a stay-at-home mother returning to work or someone returning to society after being incarcerated.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHE MADE HISTORY</strong></p><p class=dh>Having <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/06/10472377/angelica-ross-trans-queer-joy-revolutionary>appeared</a> in two different projects created by Ryan Murphy, Ross has carved a piece of history. Two of her roles include Candy on the FX show "Pose" and Nurse Rita/Dee Dee in "American Horror Story: 1984."</p><p class=dh>Rather than seeing them as coincidences or random acts of fate, Ross views them as inspiration from the universe, sometimes depending on how aware and fast she can read the signs.</p><p class=dh>In "American Horror Story," Ross said she pushed for <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/angelica-ross-legacy-pose-push-representation-set-rcna1203>defying</a> industry norms for Black people, both on and off the screen. Her commitment to this work was evident in every room she entered.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ENLISTED IN THE MILITARY</strong></p><p class=dh>Initially, Ross <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.self.com/story/being-transgender-nearly-cost-my-life>entered</a> the military to become straight. After discovering that she was gay, the star felt trapped. Due to her Christian upbringing, she believed her family would not accept her.</p><p class=dh>It was a plan gone wrong for Ross. When she attended a friend's barracks party, a man harassed her, forcing her to admit she was gay or risk getting punched by him. Eventually, she caved in and confessed.</p><p class=dh>However, the man dangled her from the window until she reaffirmed that he, too, wasn't gay. Following that, Ross voluntarily <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.self.com/story/being-transgender-nearly-cost-my-life>resigned</a> under the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy as "an admitted homosexual."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>START OF HER TRANSITION</strong></p><p class=dh>Upon her return from military service, Ross began the process of transitioning at age 19. After that, she became a model and actress for several years without ever sharing her gender identity.</p><p class=dh>In the end, Ross put her trust in a gay booking agent who was willing to handle her on a confidential basis. Meanwhile, her mother was at first skeptical of her decision to come out as transgender.</p><p class=dh>During a recent appearance on "Black Women OWN the Conversation," Ross <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.out.com/transgender/2019/9/10/how-angelica-ross-mom-came-accept-her-trans-daughter>talked</a> about how her mother was a solid Christian and believed that her transgender status was contrary to the Bible.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ONCE ENGAGED</strong></p><p class=dh>Once, Ross was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/07/24/transgender-dating-love-challenges/30562841/>engaged</a> to be married, but her fiancé asked her to keep the engagement a secret. The reason for this was that she is transgender, and her fiancé did not want other people to find out.</p><p class=dh>A man can take her to a restaurant but not home to his mother, Ross said. She pointed out that society still has a long way to go until it recognizes them as family members. In the end, she called off their engagement.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>During her time on "Pose," Ross was vocal with both her peers and fans.</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ANOTHER FAILED RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>When Ross announced in 2020 that she was no longer single, the Internet went into a frenzy.

She had to accept that the new man was not freely available to her.
