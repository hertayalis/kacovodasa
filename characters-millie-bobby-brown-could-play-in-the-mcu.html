With Eleven in Stranger Things, facing off against Godzilla and Kong in the MonsterVerse, and Sherlock’s sister Enola Holmes already in her back pocket, Brown is adding more major roles to her resume all the time. Like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming fantasy Damsel</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi actioner The Electric State</a> (both Netflix — Brown is basically Netflix royalty at this point). So it’s no wonder hopes of her imminent arrive in the MCU continue to grow.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There were once aggressive rumors</a> that Brown had a role in 2021’s Eternals, but although those came to nothing, the door remains wide open for the Godzilla vs. Kong actress to find a place in the Marvel universe as the Multiverse Saga expands. With the Young Avengers, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four being among the exciting new properties coming to the MCU over the next few years, the possibilities for the studio to best utilize Brown’s talents are endless. But let’s give them some suggestions, shall we?</p><h2 id=h-kitty-pryde data-injectable=false><strong>Kitty Pryde</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kitty-Pryde.jpg><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>Kitty Pryde is primed to become <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the new face of Marvel’s rebooted X-Men</a>, and what better person to bring her to life is there than Millie Bobby Brown? Elliot Page’s Shadowcat was sadly mostly used as a plot device in the character’s two appearances in the Fox-verse — to drive a wedge between Rogue and Iceman in The Last Stand and then to facilitate Wolverine’s time travel in Days of Future Past.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>Marvel really needs to capture what has made Kitty such a beloved character through her decades of comic book history, then, and Brown absolutely has the screen presence and the acting chops to do her justice.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Jean Grey</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jean_Grey.jpg><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>What more is there to do with Jean Grey in the movies, you might be wondering? We’ve already seen the Dark Phoenix arc play out twice on the big screen, as performed by both Famke Janssen and Sophie Turner, and neither time captured the epic nature of the original comics event. Well, clearly no one needs to see Jean go all Sith a third time, but that doesn’t mean Jean has to be put out to pasture.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Jean’s such an iconic X-Men character it would be practically sacrilege for the MCU to ignore her completely. So they could always flip the script and give us a Jean who’s actually well-adjusted and in control of her powers. After all, Scarlet Witch has kind of got the whole “absolute power corrupts absolutely” thing covered anyway. Have her dye her hair red, and Brown could make for a great lighter-hearted Jean.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Rogue</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rogue-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>We know the British-born Brown is a dab hand at a U.S. accent, thanks to her accent never slipping once in four seasons and counting of Stranger Things, but does anyone know if she can do a Southern one too? Something tells us she’d give it a pretty good stab, which is why she might be an interesting, left-field choice to play the MCU’s Rogue.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>There are so many ways Marvel could tackle Rogue, but embracing her connections to Captain Marvel — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">absorbing Carol Danvers’ powers</a> was why she turned good in the comics in the first place – is surely a smart move. Millie Bobby Brown and Brie Larson would no doubt be electric together on screen.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Mercury</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mercury-image-1.jpg><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>OK, one last X-Men suggestion. As much as fans want to see the old favorites show up, Marvel has to dig deeper into the comics for its reboot and bring some lesser-known mutants to the table as well. In that case, how about Brown getting cast as Mercury?</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Real name Cessily Kincaid, Mercury is the T-1000 to Colossus’ T-800. While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Rasputin can transform into steel</a>, Cessily can turn her body into a liquid mercury-like metal substance, allowing her to reshape her form how she pleases. She could turn out to be a surprise new favorite, especially with Brown’s help.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Valeria Richards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Valeria_Richards_29_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_581_001.jpg><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>Call me crazy, but I’m convinced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Krasinski’s comment about his Mr. Fantastic having kids</a> in Doctor Strange 2 was a hint that Marvel intends to introduce Reed and Sue’s children, Franklin and Valeria, ASAP. Combine that with the common fan theory the Fantastic Four have existed in the MCU for a while — they’ve just been trapped in the Quantum Realm — and it’s entirely possible Valeria could be a teenager in the MCU’s current timeline. Enter Brown.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>I mean, Valeria was raised by Doctor Doom, Eleven was raised by the evil Dr. Brennan. This role has her name written all over it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Captain Universe</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Captain-Universe-Tamara-Devoux.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Every time Marvel introduces a new uber-powerful character, we think “well, that’s it — they can’t get more powerful than that!” And yet they keep digging deeper into the comics to add someone even more formidable into the mix. Eventually, then, Marvel’s going to get to the point where Captain Universe is introduced, and then things will get really wild.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=827 data-injectable=true>Essentially Marvel’s answer to DC’s Doctor Manhattan, Captain Universe is able to perceive and manipulate matter on a subatomic level, giving them godlike status. There have been a few hosts of Captain Universe, who’s the guardian of Eternity (as seen in Thor: Love and Thunder) over the years, but Brown would be perfect for Tamara Devoux, an amnesiac woman who emerges from a 10-year coma to discover her new powers.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Gwen Stacy</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gwen-Stacy-feature.jpg><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>With Peter Parker and M.J. having been pulled apart by the end of Spider-Man: No Way Home, the next Spider-Man movie is all set to debut the MCU’s variant of Gwen Stacy. After Emma Stone and Hailee Steinfeld have made such an impact in the role of Peter’s ill-fated love interest in Sony’s films, it would take a very special bit of casting to measure up to them, but needless to say, Brown would fit the bill.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Black Cat</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7483F0BD-196B-450C-9A3F-DF6E3FE6860B.jpeg><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>Sticking with the Spider-Verse for a moment, another iconic female character from Spider-Man’s mythos we’ve yet to meet in the MCU is Felicia Hardy aka Black Cat. It has been confirmed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has quietly shelved its long-delayed Black Cat movie</a>, so Marvel might just be free to introduce Peter’s answer to Catwoman in Spider-Man 4. Brown could have a lot of fun playing a less squeaky-clean character for once.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Medusa</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/71E57555-826E-4852-8EAF-B6763F42E2FF.jpeg><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>Yeah, I know. Would Marvel really bring back the Inhumans in a major way after their failed TV series? Hey, Anson Mount returned as Black Bolt in Doctor Strange 2 so anything’s possible. One way of reimagining the property could be to age the Inhumans down and reveal how Black Bolt and Medusa fell in love and became king and queen of Attilan. In which case, Brown would be a fantastic choice to bring Medusa, she of the prehensile hair, to life.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Dark Angel</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dark-Angel.jpg><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>One area of its universe Marvel needs to fill out is its British superheroes — I’m sorry, we’re 15 years in and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we still don’t have a Captain Britain</a> (not counting Captain Carter)? How about bringing Brown on board as Dark Angel, then, and allowing her to retain her natural accent?</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Granted powers by the Angel of Death, Dark Angel — aka Shevaun Haldane — is part of Marvel’s supernatural side, which we know is expanding all the time (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">see the many hints at the Midnight Sons</a>). Plus, she’s got ties to Mephisto, soon to be played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sacha Baron Cohen (well, probably)</a>, as the demon killed her father. Dark Angel is also known to battle vampires — cue a Blade crossover.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>Shevaun might not be the first Marvel role for Brown that leaps to mind, but it could be the most interesting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedlr%2B3sctomqGZopawtbHRrGSmoZyhtqZ5waiZm7Fdl7%2Bww81mmqitnJl6sbjAsmSipl2ptaZ5zJysaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-sherman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Sherman</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./consuming-fire-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hillsong United Consuming Fire ly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
