However, the event came with its fair share of controversy that even brought out unexpected reactions from the UFC President Dana White.</p><p>The one that stood out the most was the controversial split decision victory of Aljamain Sterling over fan-favorite Petr Yan. The fight was evenly matched as the ‘Funkmaster’ took lead in the middle rounds, whereas ‘No Mercy’ was able to reclaim the fight in the championship rounds. However, at last, the victory was awarded to Sterling.</p><p>In a newly unearthed closeup video, White was seen disgusted by the scorecard just before Sterling was announced as the undisputed bantamweight champion of the world. This peculiar reaction by White had fans wondering what outcome the boss preferred, actually.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Good!! Aljo won 3-2 and deserved the victory.

After the event in the post-fight scrum, White actually told reporters he had it the other way.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Dana White believed Petr Yan won at UFC 273</h2><p>The first encounter between Aljamain <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Sterling</a> and Petr <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Yan</a> happened at UFC 259. The fight met with a lot of controversies, as the Russian was disqualified in the fourth round for an illegal knee to Sterling’s face.</p><p>However, it looks like the second fight has also followed suit and will go down as a split decision win that has fans and even the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>UFC</a> President second-guessing. Dana White made his opinion clear in the post-fight presser and ripped the judges for the controversial decision as well.</p><p>“I thought that the judges blew that one. I had it 3-2 the other way. I don’t know how you guys scored it. I guess it’s all in how you score that first round.”</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY- <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Five potential opponents for Aljamain Sterling after maiden title defense at UFC 273 against Petr Yan</a></strong></p><p>What are your thoughts on the decision?
