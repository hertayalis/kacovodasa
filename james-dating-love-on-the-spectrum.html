So much so that viewers want to know if James is dating anyone now, after Love on the Spectrum, or if he is still on the search for love and lasting romance.</p><p>Viewers saw him open himself up to the idea of a girlfriend in the first season. Now, in Season 2, James once again puts himself out there to date some women and figure out if there is someone out there for him after all. And you really have to admire his tenacity in dating both on and off the <a href=#>Netflix</a> docuseries.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Is ‘Love on the Spectrum’s James dating anyone now?</h2><p>Although James is in <a href=#>Season 2 of Love on the Spectrum</a> to date new women and find a long-term relationship, according to James himself, he was still single as of December 2023. When an Instagram follower commented on a photo of James out to dinner with friends and asked if he has a girlfriend, James commented back, “I do not at the moment, but I am definitely searching for one.”</p><p>And in January 2024, James shared an Instagram video about his various online dating profiles. He said that he has accounts on OKCupid, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and Hiki. So it looks like James is likely still single in early 2024, and he might still be dating around and trying to find an actual steady girlfriend.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by James B.
