Fans have always hoped that he would return to the show in some capacity, but after the Season 11 finale and its cliffhanger ending, this might actually be a possibility. <a href=# rel=noopener>Is Jack coming back to When Calls the Heart</a>? We have the answer below.</p><h2>Is Jack coming back to When Calls the Heart?</h2><p>Following the Season 11 finale, which aired on June 23, fans are convinced that Jack is coming back to When Calls the Heart, and they have some interesting theories as to how he could return.</p><p>At the very end of the episode, Elizabeth (Erin Krakow) and Nathan Grant (Kevin MGarry), who are officially back together, were approached by Superintendent Hargraves (David James Lewis). Hargraves was Nathan’s superior officer at Fort Clay and the man who suspended him from the mission that ultimately killed Elizabeth’s late husband Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing). Since Nathan had to sit out, Jack took his spot in the mission and was tragically killed by a landslide. Feeling responsible for his death, Nathan then transferred to Hope Valley to look after Elizabeth and her son, Jack Jr.</p><p>Hargraves has not been seen on the show since Season 8, when Nathan’s connection to Jack first came to light and caused him and Elizabeth to breakup. When fans same him appear on-screen again, they instantly knew it would mean trouble for the couple, who finally found their way back to each other after a full season of build up and romantic tension.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More</strong>: The Most Shocking Exits from When Calls the Heart Over the Years</a></p><p>Nathan assumed Hargraves was there to see him, but as it turns out, he had come to Hope Valley to talk to Elizabeth. “I’m not here to see you Constable,” he told Nathan, before turning to Elizabeth and saying: “Mrs. Thornton, it’s about your late husband.” Hargraves also mentioned that the matter can’t wait and needs to be discussed in private.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3.-Daniel-Lissing.png alt width=1362 height=799 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In classic WCTH fashion, the credits rolled before viewers could learn what news Hargraves had for Elizabeth, but Hearties everywhere have already begun to theorize that Jack may not actually be dead. “They buried A body. Not sure it was Jack,” one fan wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit thread</a> after the episode aired. Another fan added: “I think WCTH is cowardly for not entertaining the idea/ theory Jack is alive and out there: either with amnesia or brain damage or mistaken identity caused by trauma, something!” A third fan agreed that Jack could be alive, but noted: “I was hoping the same thing. But since he said ‘late,’ maybe they found Jack’s body?”</p><p>Another view theorized that he will show up in Season 12 in a flashback scene. “Hargreaves said ‘late husband.’ At last year’s Hearties Homecoming, [executive producer Elizabeth Sturman] and the writers talked about the need to revisit and wrap up the Ft Clay stuff. It’s very possible there will be flashback scenes and Dan might be in them, but Jack is still deceased.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> Meet the When Calls the Heart Cast’s Real-Life Partners</a></p><p><span class=s1>One Heartie suggested a completely different theory, writing: “Let’s run with the theory that Jack actually is dead … maybe the news is that Jack was deliberately killed, or someone had it out for Jack and they have a confession after all these years (and they never notified Elizabeth until they had all the facts).”</span></p><p>During <a href=# rel=noopener>our conversation with Krakow</a> ahead of the finale, the actress kept mum about what the cliffhanger could mean, but promised that it will be addressed in Season 12. “We’re not just going to pretend like that conversation at the end didn’t happen, so we will address it,” she told us. “Where it goes from there, you gotta tune in to find out.”</p><p>Unfortunately for hopeful hearties, showrunner Lindsay Sturman shut down the rumors that Jack is returning during a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Guide Magazine</a>. “Jack is not coming back, but we did want to keep his memory alive,” she told the outlet. “From the beginning of the show, it was a story about widows and for Little Jack, as he’s hitting these milestones growing up, how does Elizabeth keep Jack alive for Little Jack and hold his memory and the complexity of that when she’s in a new relationship? It was a way to complicate [Elizabeth and Nathan’s] new situation, which ends on a sweet note and then, oh no, there’s this new complexity. It can’t always be simple.”</p><p>Although fans won’t be seeing Jack back in Hope Valley anytime soon, they can watch Lissing and Krakow reunite on-screen this holiday season. The former co-stars are teaming up for a Hallmark holiday movie titled Santa Tell Me, which will premiere later this year during the network’s Countdown to Christmas special. The movie will mark the first time they have shared the screen together since Lissing left the show, as well as Lissing’s first Hallmark project since his exit.</p><p>Not many details about the former co-star’s new movie have been revealed, but a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">first look</a> was released on the same day as WCTH‘s Season 11 finale. In the clip, Krakow and Lissing’s chemistry is as strong as ever. “May I say, you two make such a lovely couple,” Santa tells their characters.</p><p>“It’s such a fantastic script. It’s so fun. There’s a lot of magical elements and reuniting with Dan was great,” Krakow told us of the project. “We hadn’t worked together in, obviously, many years, and that was just so lovely. I’m excited to get to share it with the fans.”</p><p>See what else happened in the When Calls the Heart finale <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p>When Calls the Heart is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on When Calls the Heart, check out what alums of the show, including Daniel Lissing, are up to today in the gallery below.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2qCc4WOo5ico12YvK61zaBkm5mToHq4tMSnZJyZnKHAbsDHnmShnZGnwXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-goodmans-10-best-movies-and-tv-shows.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Goodmans 10 best movies and TV shows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chicken-bryan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chicken Bryan Modern Honey</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
