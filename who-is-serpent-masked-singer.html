Want to know too? Here's the big reveal.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p><strong>Update: Fans did not see this reveal coming! On Nov. 18, it was revealed that orthopedic surgeon and viral singing sensation Dr. Elvis Francois was the voice behind the Serpent on</strong> <strong>The Masked Singer</strong> <strong>Season 4. Keep reading to see who fans initially predicted.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Season 4 of <a href=#><u>The Masked Singer</u></a> is definitely already off to an incredible start, and things are about to get even more interesting as Group B takes over. This motley crew is made up of Baby Alien, Crocodile, Gremlin, Seahorse, Whatchamacallit, and, of course, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Serpent</u></a>.</p><p>Obviously, people are already going wild trying to predict who might be hiding behind their respective masks. At the moment, we’re especially interested to know who the Serpent is.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to being one of the creepiest costumes ever featured on the show, the Serpent is also an incredibly talented performer — but who issssssss it?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is the Serpent on ‘The Masked Singer’ Season 4?</h2><p>“I am the Serpent, and that Golden Mask will be mine,” the Serpent says in a sneak preview. “I’m ready to swallow my competition whole. They may think that they stand a chance, but they’ll soon be crushed by my snake arms and my snake charms."</p><p>The Serpent’s costume features a humongous head, tons of imitation snakeskin, and —&nbsp;most notably — six animatronic snake arms that slither. (Yeah, we know snakes don’t have arms. They don’t have legs either, nor do they usually sing on a stage! Play along, OK?)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>So far, the clues regarding the Serpent’s identity are pretty vague. At first, fans were teased with a retro television set and an image of a pill bottle.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you want to know how I instantly appeared, here’s the prescription number to my identity,” the Serpent said. The pill bottle was also emblazoned with the number 31118.&nbsp;</p><p>Even more clues have surfaced since including a banana, a map of the Caribbean, and a book titled How to Dig Yourself Out of Debt.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was slithering dangerously fast down a path of destruction but my pops saved me, buying me a one-way ticket away from the wrong crowd and onto a path toward success," the Serpent explained. "I didn't want to cause pain, but heal pain."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fan guesses include 'Hamilton' stars and for the Serpent.</h2><p><strong>Leslie Odom Jr</strong>: Some people are convinced the Serpent is Leslie Odom Jr., who played Aaron Burr in Hamilton. Redditor u/TheGinger3 discovered that if you mix up the prescription number a bit, you get 31811, which is the zip code for Hamilton, Ga. Coincidence? Maybe!&nbsp;</p><p>People are also pointing to the medicine bottle as a possible connection to Rent, the show in which Leslie made his Broadway debut as Paul.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Brian McKnight, Leslie Odom Jr., and Jensen Ackles.</p></figure><p>If the Serpent isn’t Leslie Odom Jr., people have also floated the idea that it could be Christopher Jackson (who played Washington in Hamilton) or Okieriete Onaodowan (who played Hercules Mulligan and James Madison).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brian McKnight: </strong>The "Back at One" singer definitely has the pipes to be the Serpent, and fans are convinced he is under the snake costume.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’m convinced the Serpent is Brian McKnight," one fan tweeted before another added, "The #Serpent has a Brian McKnight smoothness to him."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jensen Ackles: </strong>This might be a stretch, but the Supernatural star's name has come up a few times on social media, and seeing as the CW is coming to an end after 15 seasons, this could be the beginning of Jensen's music career.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing is for sure: The Serpent can really sing. If they don’t end up winning the whole competition, they’ll almost certainly be on the show for a while. Lucky for us!</p><p>Watch Season 4 of The Masked Singer Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKydoqWyr8CMppiso5WZerS1zaCcqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./3-things-you-need-to-watch-after-that-heartbreakingly-beautiful-loki-finale.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>3 things you need to watch after that heartbreakingly beautiful Loki finale</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-dianne-feinsteins-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Dianne Feinsteins Net Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
