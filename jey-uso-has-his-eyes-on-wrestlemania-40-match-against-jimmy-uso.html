Now, it appears that WrestleMania might have already been a bit spoiled for one bit angle coming out of the Bloodline.</p><p><a href=#>Billboard </a>had a conversation with WWE Superstar Jey Uso prior to Survivor Series. During the interview, he talked about transitioning to singles competition, his desire to face his brother Jimmy Uso at WrestleMania 40, and various other topics.</p><p>Jey Uso was asked about his future WrestleMania opponent, and he has the perfect guy in mind. After all, he is currently at odds with his twin brother.</p><p>“Right now, I feel like Jimmy’s at the top of the list. He’s gotta get this work. He’s still ducking me right now. He knows what it is. If I could talk from Josh and me, it’s my dream match. If this does happen, I’d be so grateful and happy. I would just look at him like look what we doing. Look at this! Those are special moments in the ring that nobody in the world knows.”</p><p>“When we did the Money in the Bank with Roman [Reigns] and Solo, I was just looking at them getting a little teary-eyed like, “Look at us.” That would go down as the No. 1 moment in my career if I get to wrestle with Jimmy in the sold-out Philadelphia in front of friends and family. And I’d beat his ass. If I could pick someone else, I’d probably wanna run it one time with Seth Rollins for that championship. He’s a GOAT. He’s a beast and got my respect. He’s been holding down Monday Night RAW forever. I’m with it.”</p><p>The story of Jimmy vs Jey Uso has been building for year, even since the days when they wore face paint and had their tribal chant in their entrance. Fans never saw that twin feud, and that might change this time around.</p><p>The Bloodline splintered, and that called for a big change in Jimmy and Jey Uso’s stories. Jey Uso quit WWE and actually came back on a different brand to make this story last a bit longer. Only time will tell when they get back to this story, but the road to WrestleMania will start again soon.</p><p>What’s your take on Jimmy vs Jey Uso? Who do you want to win at WrestleMania?
