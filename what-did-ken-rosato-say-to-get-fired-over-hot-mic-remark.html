The channel has not issued an official statement regarding his dismissal. Rosato’s spokesman has denied that he made any racial slurs and stated that Rosato had been a strong supporter of equality during his 20-year tenure at WABC.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/jobsbots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rosato-reportedly-made-an-off-color-remark-off-air-and-was-fired-immediately-with-cause.jpg alt="Rosato reportedly made an 'off-color' remark off-air and was fired 'immediately with cause'" width=633 height=476 sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rosato reportedly made an ‘off-color’ remark off-air and was fired ‘immediately with cause’</p><p>On Friday, Ken Rosato’s former colleagues were informed of his termination in a series of one-on-one meetings, but were not provided with information about the nature of his comments. A staff email simply stated that Rosato was “no longer with WABC” and expressed appreciation for his years of service.</p><p>Rosato initially joined ABC New York as a freelance reporter in 2003 and was later given the opportunity to anchor This Morning alongside Shirleen Allicot, Heather O’Rourke, and Sam Champion in 2007. However, his presence has since been removed from ABC New York’s website and social media, including a profile segment from September 2020.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/jobsbots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/An-email-was-also-sent-out-to-staff-that-said-Rosato-is-no-longer-with-WABC.-We-thank-him-for-his-years-of-service.jpg alt="An email was also sent out to staff that said Rosato 'is no longer with WABC.

We thank him for his years of service’</p><p>In a segment from September 2020, Ken Rosato revealed that his first love was opera and his dream job was to become a veterinarian. He also spoke about his passion for cooking. When asked about the most glorious moment of his life, Rosato shared that it was when he was offered the position of morning anchor at ABC New York after his ratings spiked as a fill-in anchor. Prior to working at ABC, Rosato had worked for Fox New York and CBS Miami. He graduated from NYU, where he studied radio, Italian, and Spanish.</p><p>It appears that Rosato has suffered a similar fate as Don Lemon, who was fired in April after making derogatory comments about Jon Stewart on a hot mic. The incident was one of several that contributed to Lemon’s departure from CNN. On his morning show, Lemon played a clip of Stewart interviewing US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and made comments about Stewart’s status as a comedian. He later backtracked and attempted to mitigate the situation, emphasizing that Stewart is a thought leader and advocate for American servicemen and first responders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kxKmt02abopxdoLKvedGoqpqsn2LAosWMraZmn5Wpeqe10Z6bZqemmr9utM6tZKahk2K%2FprnAq6Jo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ghost-hunters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Ghost Hunters' Reboot Cast, Locations, and Where Is Jason?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hong-chau.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watchmen Actress, Hong Chau Is Still Marked As Unmarried; Achieved Numerous Of Nomination From Downs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
