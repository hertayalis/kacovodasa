Following a series of highs and lows in their marriage, Jana announced on Instagram in the spring of 2021 that their relationship had come to an end.</p><p>“But I think about this year, my kids won’t wake up at my house Christmas Day. That one’s gonna hurt.”</p><p>“That’s when I get like, that’s not fair,” Jana continued. “‘You took away my dream too of what I wanted for my family. That’s not fair.'”</p><p>While Mike, a former NFL player, has not publicly responded to Jana’s comments, he has previously spoken out about his infidelity and entered rehab in 2016 for sex addiction.</p><p>They separated one year after their wedding while Caussin sought treatment for sex addiction. They gave their marriage another shot in 2017 and co-wrote the book “The Good Fight: Wanting to Leave, Choosing to Stay, and the Powerful Practice for Loving Faithfully” in 2020.</p><p>In a&nbsp;2019 interview with&nbsp;ABC News,&nbsp;Caussin said that the addiction “manifests in different ways for different people.”</p><p>“It doesn’t come from me wanting to have sex,” he said,&nbsp;“it’s me feeling a certain way and from my entire life&nbsp;looking back, I just used sex as kind of my escape.” Caussin added that when he cheated, he told her, “We’re honest with one another and said we haven’t been perfect, let’s be perfect for each other, or try to be.”</p><p>The pair fought to rebuild their relationship, but&nbsp;ultimately ended things in 2021&nbsp;after six years of marriage.&nbsp;Kramer and Caussin&nbsp;finalized their divorce&nbsp;in July of that year.</p><p>Kramer revealed on social media in April of 2021 that their marriage was over for good.</p><p>“It’s time,” she said. “As I try to make sense of a reality that I never wanted to believe could be possible again, those words have now become a reality. I’ve fought y’all. I’ve loved hard. I’ve forgiven. I’ve put the work in. I’ve given everything I have, and now I have nothing else to give. ‘It’s time.'”</p><p>She reassured her followers that she still believed in marriage, love and rebuilding but that it was “time to heal.”</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqoqaXmr9utsCnmGajopa6pr6MqKeepqNiwrF5wJumrqxdnbKzecSxZKGto5eur7DSZqCnnpmZsq2107JksKGknXqwwsSrZGprXay8rrHNaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stefano-domenical-net-worth-income-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stefano Domenical Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ncis-recap.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NCIS Recap 4/4/17: Season 14 Episode 20 A Bowl of Cherries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
