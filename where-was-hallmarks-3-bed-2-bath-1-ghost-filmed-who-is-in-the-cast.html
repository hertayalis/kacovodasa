This confidence is torn apart when she encounters a ghost named Ruby from the 1920s who refuses to leave the property for good as she wants her home to remain unoccupied. As Anna and Ruby spend some time together, they unexpectedly discover that they share some commonalities, including the fact that they left their respective fiancés.</p><p>While Ruby called it quits with her lover because of her father’s disapproval, Anna got out of her relationship when their renovation business turned out to be a failure. Now, the spirit of Ruby believes that she cannot pass over until she helps Anna rekindle her love for her ex.
