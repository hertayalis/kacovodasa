The No Doubt singer and the country crooner met through the show, and Shelton also connected with several other famous folks, like Christina Aguilera. One year, Shelton said he received a bizarre gift from Aguilera for Christmas. Here’s what she gave him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-star-christina-aguilera-once-gave-blake-shelton-a-2-headed-duck-for-christmas>‘The Voice’ star Christina Aguilera once gave Blake Shelton a 2-headed duck for Christmas</h2><p id=par-2_77>The Voice featured Christina Aguilera as a coach in seasons 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10, and she got to know Blake Shelton quite well. <a href=#>Shelton was a staple in the series</a>, but <a href=#>he left after season 23</a> to pursue other passions and spend time with family. Fans who follow the country star know he loves to bust the chops of his fellow coaches. And in 2013, he revealed what Aguilera got him for Christmas.</p><p id=par-3_43>“She got me for Christmas, a two-headed duck,” Shelton told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Extra</a> in 2013. “It was like, mounted, or whatever. People come over like, ‘Where’d you get a two-headed duck?’ What do you mean? From the same place everybody gets it. From Christina Aguilera.”</p><p id=par-4_27>Aside from the two-headed duck, Shelton revealed a great gift others can give him for Christmas. “Alcohol is always in high demand around my house,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Shelton said Christina Aguilera has ‘swagger’ and ‘confidence’ that make her fun to be around</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Voice-Blake-Shelton-Christina-Aguilera.jpg><p id=par-5_38>The Voice brought coaches Blake Shelton and Christina Aguilera together, and they formed a tight bond from the show. While speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SiriusXM</a> in 2013, Shelton explained why he felt that being around Aguilera was “good” for him.</p><p id=par-6_66>“She’s got this swagger about her that she’s just got this confidence, and she doesn’t care if you like it or not,” Shelton said. “I mean, she’s Christina. I’m not saying that we don’t fight and argue. I get mad at her, Adam gets mad at her, she gets mad at us. But she knows who she is, and she will not back off of that.”</p><p id=par-7_43>“When I started this thing, I would of never, ever, ever thought in a million years that Christina Aguilera would be somebody that I would call a good friend,” the country star continued. “… She’s actually a buddy. We have things in common.”</p><p id=par-8_67>Aguilera was also an outspoken advocate of Shelton’s relationship with Gwen Stefani when it first began. “All I do know — from knowing Blake from so many seasons past and holding hands with the guys from season one [and] knowing Gwen for even longer than that, going to each other’s kids’ birthday parties, etc. — they’re great people,” the pop star told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Shelton will spend Christmas with Gwen Stefani and her kids in Oklahoma</h2><p id=par-9_61>Blake Shelton likely won’t see Christina Aguilera for Christmas in 2023, as he’ll spend the holidays in Oklahoma <a href=#>with Gwen Stefani and her three boys</a>. Stefani posted video footage of her decorating the Oklahoma ranch with a Christmas tree and an illuminated village over fake snow. In 2017, she talked about how her holidays have changed since being with Shelton.</p><p id=par-10_81>“For me, it’s weird when traditions change,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> at the time. “But it’s also fun to be flexible. So, we have incorporated an Oklahoma Christmas in, and Christmas now has been really fun for the boys and for my family. Last year, [the boys] had their dad’s Christmas, and then&nbsp;my Christmas, and then we went to Oklahoma, so they got to do three Christmases. We just keep it going. They’re always asking, ‘Are we going to get more presents?!’”</p><p id=par-11_23>Shelton and Stefani plan on working on New Year’s Eve, so we’re sure they’ll enjoy the short holiday season together while they can.</p><p id=par-12_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvra3KnmSsoJWhwbC6jKucnJ2Zq7KlecGisZqqopp6pLTRoqqtpZGoeqi1xa1knKCinsC1tc2aZJqfpZ65pr7AZ5%2BtpZxk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-arthur-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Arthur Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alaskan-bush-peoples-legal-dramas-seem-never-ending.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alaskan Bush People's Legal Dramas Seem Never-Ending</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
