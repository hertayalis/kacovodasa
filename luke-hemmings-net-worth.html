He shares the same parents with his two older brothers; Ben and Jack.</p><p>Hemmings’ brothers first taught him how to play the guitar when he was ten years old, which subsequently inspired him to seek formal classes and learn via YouTube instructional videos. Hemmings eventually started busking during his later childhood.</p><p>Hemmings transferred schools in Year 7 and enrolled at Norwest Christian College, where he met future bandmates Calum Hood and Michael Clifford. Hemmings subsequently admitted that Clifford and he had been “enemies” before they became friends.</p><p>Hemmings soon became friends with Hood after they sang a cover of Secondhand Serenade at a school talent show, and he later became friends with Clifford after discovering they had a love for music.</p><p>Hemmings chose to convert to remote learning in order to finish high school after the band’s ascent to stardom.</p><p>Due to his dedication to the band, he decided not to complete Year 12, the last year of secondary education in Australia, in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09093018/luke-hemmings-press-2021-cr-davis-bates-billboard-1548-1628631147.webp?resize=770%2C509&ssl=1"><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luke Hemmings career</h2><p>Hemmings started uploading YouTube song cover videos in 2011 when he was 14 years old under the handle “hemmo1996.”</p><p>The debut video by Hemmings, a cover of “Please Don’t Go” by Mike Posner, was published on February 3, 2011. Hemmings encouraged Hood and Clifford to participate in his videos as his covers gained popularity on the platform.</p><p>The present lineup of 5 Seconds of Summer was formed when the trio eventually included their common friend Ashton Irwin in their videos. On December 3, 2011, they had their first official show in a tavern in their hometown.</p><p>The band acquired a publishing agreement with Sony/ATV Music Publishing after uploading song covers online for several months and generating attention from major record companies and publishers.</p><p>Since then, Hemmings has collaborated with the band to release five studio albums, all of which have achieved international success: 5 Seconds of Summer (2014), Sounds Good Feels Good (2015), Youngblood (2018), Calm (2020), and 5SOS5 (2022).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09095644/luke-solo-1.jpg><p>Hemmings has pursued modeling in addition to the band.
