In a recent interview with Today, Mindy said that she tries to keep their lives in order in spite of Arik's hectic and demanding schedule.</p><p>“No one else can understand that pressure to be kind of this emotional powerhouse and support system for your significant other,” she said during the interview.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She added that the wives of NFL players bond really quickly as a result of the unusual lives that they all lead.</p><p>“I think we really band together, and you end up making super-fast friends because of that," she explained. "We’re all part of this team. We’re anxious and worried, and we’re thinking about, ‘Are things taken care of at home so that they can focus on the game?’”</p><p>Mindy also added that Arik relies on her to keep their day-to-day lives humming.</p><p>“I’ve got to take the car for the oil change and I've got to do all the daycare tours and do the fun things, but also the not so fun things,” she explained.</p><p>Although all eyes are on the players on game day, Mindy has managed to become a fairly prominent online personality in her own right, and has an Instagram following of more than 500,000, which is roughly double what her husband's is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@arikarmstead</span></figure><p>Mindy posts photos of her own life, which obviously overlaps with her husband's, but also includes plenty of photos of the two young kids they share. Mindy may support her husband on gameday, but her Instagram makes it clear that she also takes plenty of time to live her own life.</p><p>Of course, Arik's busy season is the fall and winter, when the NFL is in season, but he also gets a fairly lengthy break each year when he can be a more regular husband and father. Professional sports careers are typically pretty short, which means it makes sense that Arik is prioritizing his life on the field while he can still get paid for doing it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bqt4yaqaarpJqupXnWop2e</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./launching-the-cpu-overload-project-testing-every-x86-desktop-processor-since-2010.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Benchmark Automation - Launching the #CPUOverload Project: Testing Every x86 Desktop Processor since</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aaa-to-feds-stop-ny-nj-bridge-tunnel-toll-hike.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stop NY-NJ bridge, tunnel toll hike</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
