He played for the Detroit Lions, Baltimore Colts, and Chicago Bears.He was the first quarterback selected in the first round (11th overall) of the 1968 NFL Draft after a stellar career at the University of Massachusetts Amherst where he was selected All-Yankee Conference for two seasons. In 1971, as a member of the Lions, he passed for 2,237 yards and 16 touchdowns and was named to his only Pro Bowl that year.In 1976, he passed for 2,191 yards and 17 touchdowns and was named the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year.After setting a couple of passing records with the Lions, he moved on to play for the Baltimore Colts for three seasons where in 1979, as a member of the Colts, he played brilliantly despite a 5-11 record and a season-ending injury to starting quarterback Bert Jones. He passed for a career best 2,932 yards and 15 touchdowns that season. He then played for George Allen on the Chicago Blitz and Arizona Wranglers in the United States Football League in 1983 and 1984. He also played one season with the Chicago Bears before retiring as a player in 1984.Landry was also notable as a rusher, in addition to his passing. He rushed for over 2600 yards and 21 touchdowns in his career, exceeding 500 yards on the ground in both 1971 and 1972, as well as averaging ten yards per carry in 1970 and scoring 9 touchdowns in 1972.Landry began his coaching career in 1985, handling the Cleveland Browns quarterbacks and later joined Mike Ditka's staff as quarterback coach in 1986, following the Bears Super Bowl rout of the New England Patriots.With the Bears, he was also the wide receivers and tight ends coach before taking over as offensive coordinator from 1988 to 1992 where he was a part of six division championships.Following the 1992 season he was hired as the offensive coordinator at the University of Illinois for 2 seasons. In 1994, Illinois had the second-best passing offense in the Big Ten Conference, which carried the team to a 30-0 win in the Liberty Bowl over East Carolina, which was making its first bowl appearance in 16 seasons.After that, Landry was back with the Lions as the team's quarterback coach, where in 1995 the Lions were the top offensive unit in the NFL and tutored Scott Mitchell to record setting passing numbers that season. He retired from coaching after the 1996 season and became a local radio host.He currently ranks third on all-time Lions career yardage list (12,451) and ranks second in touchdown passes with 80.In 2012, Landry was inducted into the Natioanl Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. {http://polishsportshof.com/inductees/football/greg-landry/} ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 18, 1946</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Nashua, New Hampshire, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 4" (1.93 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football player</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Greg Landry, Landry, Greg</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Sagittarius</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Led the NFL in Yards per Pass Completion (16.4) in 1971.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>Quarterback for the Detroit Lions (1968-1978), Baltimore Colts (1979-1981) and Chicago Bears (1984).</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=7.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>ESPN SportsCentury</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TNT Sunday Night Football</td><td>1990-1991</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Chicago Bears Offensive Coordinator</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>The NFL on NBC</td><td>1970-1990</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Detroit Lions Quarterback / Himself - Chicago Bears Offensive Coordinator / Himself - Baltimore Colts Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The NFL on CBS</td><td>1970-1990</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Chicago Bears Offensive Coordinator / Himself - Detroit Lions Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>NFL Monday Night Football</td><td>1970-1975</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Detroit Lions Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1971 NFL Pro Bowl</td><td>1971</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - NFC Quarterback</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1712519_Greg-Landry/1712519_The-NFL-on-CBS-19701990.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqecrWWnpL%2B1tI6gqZ6fXaGur7DRsmSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sampletalent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hire Erykah Badu for a Corporate Event or Performance Booking.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./frescos-naturales-on-shark-tank-season-14-founder-drinks-price-and-flavor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Frescos Naturales on Shark Tank season 14, founder, drinks price and flavor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
