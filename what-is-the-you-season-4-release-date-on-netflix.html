Initially broadcast on the Lifetime network, the series follows Joe Goldberg, a man who manages a bookstore. However, Joe has a dark side he keeps hidden from most people in his life: by night, he is a notorious serial killer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>However, his life becomes even more complex when he meets and becomes obsessed with Guinevere Beck, an aspiring writer. This leads Joe down a dark path as his newfound obsession and his already existing dark side merge together. As the show progresses, his cycles of aggression and fixation become more intense as he finds new people to obsess over. On top of this, it becomes harder and harder to keep his nefarious deeds a secret. This forces those around him to adapt and for Joe to move around to avoid getting caught.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=49 data-current-count=49 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix describes</a> season 4 of the show by saying:</p><p>“As fans of the show know, each season of&nbsp;You&nbsp;explores and subverts various genres as Joe searches for love. Season 1 was a classic stalker thriller, offering an irreverent take on tried-and-true rom-com tropes; Season 2 had more of a revenge motif and challenged traditional love-interest expectations, and Season 3 threw Joe into a domestic thriller — almost a suburban noir, complete with swinging neighbors. With Season 4,&nbsp;You&nbsp;transforms into a straight-up murder mystery a la Agatha Christie (or maybe&nbsp;Glass Onion). In other words, Joe’s life is going to become a lot more complicated, whether he wants it to or not.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-will-season-4-of-you-be-released data-injectable=false>When will season 4 of You be released?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>While the first season was on the Lifetime network, Lifetime canceled its order for a second season. This led to the show being acquired by Netflix. The company would order the second and third seasons, which landed in 2019 and 2021. The move to streaming helped the show immensely as it drew many new eyes to the series, leading to it developing a sizable and vocal fanbase.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>When the third installment launched, Netflix confirmed that it had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered a fourth season</a>. Filming started in March, meaning fans have been waiting quite a while to learn when they can become reacquainted with Joe and his dark side. This hype only grew more intense in September when Netflix unveiled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a special preview of the upcoming season</a> at their Tudum event, introducing fans to a load of new characters and the show’s new setting.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Thankfully, Netflix has finally confirmed when viewers can expect to see more of Joe’s adventures. The streaming giant has confirmed that the fourth season will debut on Feb. 9th, 2023. This season will be split into two batches, each consisting of five episodes. The first lands on February 9th, and the second will arrive on the platform on March 9, 2023.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam1pnnYqKxmq5WWwLC6jG1kq52cmq60sYydmK2dXaS7brrErZ2loahk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cherry-mx-10-0n-rgb-keyboard-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>CHERRY MX 10.0N RGB Keyboard Review: Vibrant Lighting, but Too Simplistic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-tragic-story-of-warren-jeffs-son-roy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Tragic Story Of Warren Jeffs' Son Roy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
