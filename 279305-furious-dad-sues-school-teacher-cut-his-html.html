The suit, filed on September 14, named the perpetrators as Kelly Mogg, Jurnee's library teacher and teaching assistant Kristen Jacobs.</p><p class=fh>The father accused the librarian of cutting off his daughter's remaining hair with Jacobs' assistance.

Amy Bond, President of Mount Pleasant Public Schools Board of Education, described the allegations as baseless, vowing to defend their stance in court aggressively.</p><p class=fh>Jurnee is hardly the first student to endure such treatment at the hands of a teacher.
