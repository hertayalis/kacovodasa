You know, always loving and caring and always willing to give a helping hand, a kind word. He was a great son,” Sharlene said.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Reaction to death of UGA football player Devin Willock and staff member Chandler LeCroy</strong></a></p><p>She said he was so proud to be a Georgia Bulldog and when they won back-to-back titles, his mom laughed and said he wouldn’t stop talking and kept telling her: “I told you we would do it. We have the best team.”</p><p>“He was so proud of that team,” she added.</p><p>Sharlene said Devin was one of three brothers. One, an older half-brother died a couple years ago, she said.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NorthJersey.com publication</a>, his father, David Willock, said a 2009 crash took the life of Jonathan Wheatley when he was driving with a group of friends. He was also 20-years-old.</p><p>"It was the same exact way — same way, same age, same everything," David told the newspaper. "It's really hard."</p><p>Sharlene said he was originally going to go to Penn State, but flipped to the Bulldogs to make it easier for his family to attend games. She said they have family in Gainesville, so it was going to make traveling to the games more doable.</p><p>His dad said the family was all in Athens for the championship celebration. After the game, they went to dinner at Texas Roadhouse, he told the newspaper.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Heartwarming moment shared on Twitter hours before UGA football player's death</strong></a></p><p>When asked about the interaction with the young boy seen on Twitter that night, his mom said that’s exactly who he was.</p><p lang=art dir=ltr>❤️❤️❤️ <a href=#>https://t.co/BILVqifxhO</a></p>— Devin Willock (@DevinWillock) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a><p>“He wouldn’t hurt a soul.
