She has high hopes for her son Grand Prince Gye-seong, who does better at his academics and is less troublesome. But the prince has a secret that could lead to his demise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_79>Actor Yoo Seon-ho joined the cast of Under the Queen’s Umbrella as Gye-seong.
