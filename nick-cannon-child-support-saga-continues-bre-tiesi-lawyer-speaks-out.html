Or because he is who he is, they could say, 'We know you can afford X amount for each household.'"</p><p id=e9VaL_WzV_M data-wc=30>However, her lawyer Neama Rahmani has called out her client's claims as "absolutely not true," and even told her via an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>: <strong>"Bre, you should know better!"</strong></p><p id=ePp1NCDmu5O data-wc=17><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Nick Cannon's insane birthday party for 12-year-old twins – and you'll never believe what he did</a></strong></p><p id=ePWNvfWdNv2 data-wc=34>She explained: "There's no cap on child support based on the number of children.
