A pair of Survivor competitors ultimately drew an upset and two challengers were nominated for the first time.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>After the dust settled in the Arena, Survivor winner and multiple-time Challenge alum Michele Fitzgerald was ousted and joined the 13 other hopefuls eliminated from the CBS series.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>So, what went down in episode 12 on Oct. 5, and what happened to Michele? Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id=h-chris-underwood-finally-secured-safety-by-winning-a-daily-challenge-alongside-desi-williams-who-wanted-to-right-a-wrong data-injectable=false>Chris Underwood finally secured safety by winning a Daily Challenge alongside Desi Williams, who wanted to right a wrong</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>The episode began with Survivor: Edge of Extinction winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Underwood</a> returning to the Challenge house after notching his third consecutive elimination victory, and fourth overall. Chris took on two-time Big Brother star Tyler Crispen in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 11’s Arena</a>, and he emerged victorious in “Barrel Tag.”</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>Although the other male competitors knew Chris was a threat and someone they wanted out of the game, the four of them (MTV’s The Challenge veterans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Wharton</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John “Johnny Bananas” Devenanzio,</a> and former Big Brother houseguests Josh Martinez and Faysal Shafaat) came together to confirm they wanted women to compete in the next elimination round.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>On the other end, The Challenge champ Tori Deal investigated why she had three balls in The Hopper during the last go-around. She figured out it was Survivor’s Desi Williams, Chanelle Howell, and Chris who tossed their votes onto her. Riddled with guilt and the realization that the proven veteran would gun for her, Desi apologized to Tori.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>However, she, Chanelle, and Michaela Bradshaw also took aim at Michele by attempting to pin the betrayal on the Survivor: Kaôh Rōng winner, which led to a verbal sparring match between her and Michaela.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Fast forward to the Daily Challenge, and the lines had been clearly drawn. The two major alliances (The Challenge vets featuring Bananas, Tori, Cory, Faysal, and Josh, and the former Survivor castaways with Chris, Desi, Michaela, and Chanelle) went to war in the solo-based challenge.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Also knowing the Final was imminent, the 11 players gunned for the victory in “Brain Squeeze,” a Daily that had them racing through the narrow and maze-like Punta Christo Fort in Pula, Croatia, searching for bags of puzzle pieces.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>The bags weren’t only large and bulky, the challengers also had to run a long distance to transport them while only being allowed to take one at a time.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Although the Challenge vets crew appeared ahead of their opposition, it was Desi and Chris who finished their puzzles first. The veteran alliance operated under the assumption that there were only seven bags of puzzle pieces, whereas the Survivor group located an eighth deep into the fort.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>It was a massive win for Chris, to say the least. Whether it was from a direct vote or through The Hopper, he had found himself battling in the sand the past three rounds of play. Triumphing in Brain Squeeze meant he could finally rest and yield some power. And for Desi, her first individual win this season meant she could further mitigate the damage she caused to her relationship with Tori — someone she respected and gave her word to.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Cassidy Clark found herself opposite Michele in the Arena, and she earned her third elimination victory</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>It was clear that by the time Michaela and Michele finished squabbling, the latter had become the main target of the Survivor alliance. They had hoped Michele would stick with them and vote in Tori last episode, but she chose to throw one on her fellow Survivor winner (Chris) instead, effectively choosing The Challenge veterans over her original show’s alliance.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>So, when Desi and Chris sat down at the nomination deliberation, Desi made it clear she wanted Tori out of the Arena and Michele in. Chris obliged with no resistance. Then, they shifted focus onto the men. Besides Cory, who Chris admitted had shown him some semblance of loyalty, everyone else seemed fair game.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Wanting to cause some paranoia, Chris went with Josh, the Big Brother 19 winner who had yet to sit on the chopping block, and Desi agreed.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Once the house became aware of their nominations, and Josh let out a few tears, the plan was set in motion to make it a women’s elimination day. In the past four rounds, four men and one woman went home, and considering the possibility that there’d be one more double-elimination, the contestants saw it in their favor to even up the score.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>It wasn’t a surprise to see how it worked out when they arrived at the Arena. While Michele voted for Cory and Survivor 43’s Cassidy Clark placed a ball for Chanelle, the two power alliances all voted for Cassidy.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Considering she wasn’t part of any dominant alliance and had seen elimination twice already, Cassidy was the perfect scapegoat.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>With the odds heavily stacked against her, longtime host TJ Lavin pulled her ball from The Hopper, signaling the second Survivor alum vs. Survivor alum matchup of USA 2.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Cassidy entered the contest with wins over Big Brother’s Alyssa Snider and Alyssa Lopez, whereas Michele won the first Arena of the season against another ex-Big Brother houseguest, Ameerah Jones.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>With it being a single-elimination day, Josh and Cory were spared, and Cassidy joined Michele and TJ in the sand.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>They played “Hot Wheel,” a game that tested their endurance, strength, and strategic thinking. The Arena game required the women to spin a steering wheel back and forth. Their wheels were attached to a bar with a torch at the end of it, and the aim was to use the flame to light their six targets.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>The match started as a back-and-forth struggle with no one earning the upper hand. But, after Cassidy lit her second target, she took over and defeated Michele 6-1. That was enough to end Michele’s campaign toward $250,000, and her third appearance in the franchise once again wrapped before the Final Challenge.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>However, the 33-year-old’s time competing on The Challenge isn’t over. She’ll be back later this month as part of season 39’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle for a New Champion</a>. She and Tori are the only players from USA 2 who are set to appear on the MTV flagship series’ next addition.</p><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=42 data-injectable=false>So, what’s in store for episode 13?</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>At the end of the episode, we saw snippets of what’s to come. And it looks like the cast will deal with one more double-elimination before the Final Challenge. The first season’s cast had the luxury of having 10 spots in the Final. But, it sounds like only eight players will fight for the grand prize and the illustrious champion accolade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrp6mpGK1sLnEZqanZaSdsm6vx5qjpZ2enLJuwdKaZKydkai8r3mRZpypoaOksaZ5kGtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tec-shark-tank-net-worth-2024-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tec Shark Tank Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emi-hobbs-obituary-toledo-ohio-in-loving-memory-of-emi-hobbs.html>Emi Hobbs Obituary, Toledo, Ohio, In Loving Memory Of Emi Hobbs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./klorane-strengthening-shampoo-gorgeous-hair-event-ulta-7499025.html>The Strengthening Shampoo That Adds Fullness to Hair Is 50% Off Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./valeri-bure-net-worth-190742.html>Valeri Bure Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia.
