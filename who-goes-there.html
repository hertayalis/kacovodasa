The lyrics are spoken from the perspective of a loner who just lost his only romantic interest. "Summer is over, now I'm going nowhere," meaning that he feels lost and directionless now that his summer (a metaphor for his relationship) is over. He's aware that he's alone but still doesn't want to be near anyone else. "But I don't wanna go, go, go there / You're sober, that's not me I'm a stoner / I prefer it when the world moves slower," shows that he is aware that he's not like everyone else, and he doesn't belong where people are sober and in a rush. He prefers a slower pace and a world that is more chaotic.</p><br><p>The second verse seems to be about his current state of mind. He's feeling indifferent and distant from the world, and he's working all the time. Even though every Friday is like Halloween to him, it doesn't bring him any joy or excitement. He's a loner and prefers it that way, but he's aware that people want things from him, and he has to be on his guard all the time. He's waiting to be "summoned" even though he knows that everything is bound to change.</p><br><p>Overall, "Who Goes There" shows Bladee's feelings of loneliness, detachment, and indifference. He's aware that he's different from other people and that he's not interested in the things they find important. He's struggling to find his place in the world and is waiting for something to happen that will give him a sense of purpose and direction.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Who goes there, it's the ghost of october</u><br>I am here, but I'm like a ghost from the past, a haunting reminder of October that no one wants to see</p><br><p><u>Summer is over, now I'm going nowhere</u><br>With the end of summer comes stagnation, and I feel like I'm not going anywhere in life</p><br><p><u>Who holds her, it's not me i'm a loner</u><br>I cannot hold onto someone because I am often alone and detached from others</p><br><p><u>But I don't wanna go, go, go there</u><br>Despite my loneliness, I don't want to go to that place of emotional attachment and vulnerability</p><br><p><u>You're sober, that's not me I'm a stoner</u><br>I am not like you, I am not sober, I am a stoner who prefers to escape reality</p><br><p><u>I prefer it when the world moves slower</u><br>I am more comfortable when things move at a slower pace as it gives me time to process my thoughts</p><br><p><u>Who goes there, it's just me I'm a soldier</u><br>I am the only one here, fighting a battle against my own inner demons, and I am the only one that can persevere</p><br><p><u>I come from the snow, it's cold, cold, colder</u><br>My past is a place of loneliness and isolation, where nothing ever changed, and it was always bitterly cold</p><br><p><u>You don't know what I am, I'm a sick man</u><br>You cannot understand the pain and suffering that I carry with me, and that is what makes me a sick man</p><br><p><u>And this world feels so distant</u><br>The world around me seems like it's slowly slipping away from my grasp, and I feel helpless to stop it</p><br><p><u>But today I'm feeling so indifferent</u><br>Today, I feel nothing.
